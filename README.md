# sequence-models

My personal notes on sequence modelling using deep learning. Contains a mixture of theory in `notes` and implementations in `src` and/or `notebooks`.

- `src`: Python modules containing models and helper functions
- `notebooks`: Implementations and demos. Not all models necessarily will have notebooks. Look at `src/seq` for a full list.
- `notes`: My personal notes on sequence models
- `figures`: Pictures for `notes` and `notebooks`
